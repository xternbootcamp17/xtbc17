You'll need a code-friendly text editor. If you already have a strong preference for one in particular, knock yourself out. If not, we have a couple of recommendations.

{{% h "vs-logo.svg" %}}
Visual Studio Code
{{% /h %}}

**[Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)** is a free, open source editor from Microsoft---but don't let that scare you. It doesn't feel the least bit like a lazy port of a Windows product, because it isn't one. It was build from the ground up to be cross-platform. It's only two years old, but it's impressive.

VS Code is particularly well suited for JavaScript development. It has Microsoft's famous IntelliSense, built-in support for Git, and a variety of extensions to make our lives easier.

We will be using Visual Studio Code in class.

### Recommended Extensions for VS Code

* [**vscode-icons**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons) shows icons in the sidebar that correspond to the file type.

ATOM
{{% /h %}}

**[Atom](https://atom.io/)** is free, open source editor from GitHub. It's only been around a little longer than Code---about three years---but it's quickly become a favorite. If you aren't interested in VS Code, give Atom a chance.

### Recommended Packages for Atom

Atom is highly extensible, and there are a few packages that I highly recommend.

* [`linter-eslint`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) checks for JavaScript errors and style violations on the fly.
* [`language-babel`](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) adds support for the latest JavaScript features.
* [`react`](https://atom.io/packages/react) adds support for React's JSX language.
* [`file-icons`](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons) shows icons in the sidebar that correspond to the file type.
* [`Sublime-Style-Column-Selection`](https://atom.io/packages/Sublime-Style-Column-Selection) is really handy when you've pasted something in with a bunch of junk at the beginning of each line.
* [`autocomplete-plus`](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus) and [`atom-ternjs`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ternjs) combine to do pretty nice autocompletion for JavaScript. TernJS even provides inline documentation for functions.

## Other Editors

**[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** is another popular choice. Many of Atom's features are borrowed from Sublime Text (which took them from TextMate). Sublime Text is commercial software, although the trial version does not expire. If you like it, consider coughing up the $70.

If you're used to a full IDE, **[WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)** might be more up your alley. Be warned: It's subscription-based, and is $12.90/month, or $129.00 the first year. You may find that Visual Studio Code has most of the features you need. We've never used WebStorm ourselves, so we won't be much help should you run into trouble.

## Dock That Rascal

Whichever editor you use, you'll use it enough that I recommend keeping it in the Dock as well.

{{% aside tip "Theme Info" %}}
Since I'm always asked, I use the following themes:

* Code: _Oceanic Next Italic_
* Atom: _Atom Dark_ UI theme; _Kobalt_ syntax theme (with some personal customizations)
