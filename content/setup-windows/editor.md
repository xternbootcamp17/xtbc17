You'll need a code-friendly text editor. If you already have a strong preference for one in particular, knock yourself out. If not, we have a recommendation.

Visual Studio Code

**[Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)** is a free, open source editor from Microsoft. It was built from the ground up to be cross-platform. It's only two years old, but it's impressive.

VS Code is particularly well suited for JavaScript development. It has Microsoft's famous IntelliSense, built-in support for Git, and a variety of extensions to make our lives easier.

We will be using Visual Studio Code in class.

When given the chance to **Select Additional Tasks** during setup, go ahead and check all the boxes.

### Recommended Extensions for VS Code

## Other Editors

**[Atom](https://atom.io/)** is a free, open source editor from GitHub. It's only been around a little longer than Code---about three years---but it's quickly become a favorite. If you aren't interested in VS Code, give Atom a chance.

**[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** is another popular choice. Many of Atom's features are borrowed from Sublime Text (which took them from TextMate). Sublime Text is commercial software, although the trial version does not expire. If you like it, consider coughing up the $70.

If you're used to a full IDE, **[WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)** might be more up your alley. Be warned: It's subscription-based, and is $12.90/month, or $129.00 the first year. You may find that Visual Studio Code has most of the features you need. We've never used WebStorm ourselves, so we won't be much help should you run into trouble.

## Pin That Rascal

Whichever editor you use, you'll use it enough that I recommend pinning it to the taskbar.

{{% aside tip "Theme Info" %}}
Since I'm always asked, I use the following themes:

* Code: _Oceanic Next Italic_
* Atom: _Atom Dark_ UI theme; _Kobalt_ syntax theme (with some personal customizations)
