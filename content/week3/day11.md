Congratulations, you survived the bootcamp! You're all experts in React now, right?

_Just kidding_.  We've got a good handle on the basics of React and web development, but it's important to keep pushing yourself to solidify the concepts you've learned and continue extending your skills.  We've compiled a list of some resources to continue your journey towards becoming a competent web developer.

## Resources for continued learning

### JavaScript

* [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) - this was part of the optional pre-work, but it was definitely on the difficult side. If you haven't completed it already, you should definitely have the skills to complete it now.
* [Understanding ES6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read) - I really enjoyed reading this free e-book. It's well-written with good explanations, and helped solidify my understanding of how JavaScript works.
* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) - All are free resources for solving practice problems (and seeing other people's solutions) in the language of your choice.  Excellent for leveling up your skills.

### React

* [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/) - Training on all sorts of React-related topics by the team that created React Router.  Some lessons are free, some are paid, but they're all really good.
* [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) - An excellent tutorial for learning how to build an app (Instagram clone) using Redux - one of the most popular patterns for creating scalable React apps.

### Development

* [The Conjoined Triangles of Senior Level Development](http://frontside.io/blog/2016/07/07/the-conjoined-triangles-of-senior-level-development.html) - This is where the Technical Capability/Leadership/Community Venn diagram came from.
* [Tony Dewan's Scale of Awesomeness](http://decidedlycursory.com/post/30869180028/scale-of-awesomeness)
  * [Twitter thread in which Tony followed up with a few more items](https://twitter.com/tonydewan/status/618583219101810688)
