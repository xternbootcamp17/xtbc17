[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is my favorite of the free GUIs for Git. It's made by GitHub, but there's nothing tying it to their service. It's just a Git client, and it will work fine with any host, or just locally. Check out GitHub's guide: [Getting your project on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/).
