## Welcome!

Congratulations on being accepted to the 2017 XTERN Bootcamp! This class will be a lot of fun and a lot of hard work, and by the end you'll be able to create front-end web applications in React, one of the hottest JavaScript libraries on the market today. 

In order to make sure everyone gets as much as possible out of this experience, it’s vitally important that everyone arrives with a solid understanding of the JavaScript language. That way, we get to focus on learning React and building cool stuff instead of spending all of our time on basic syntax.

You have already received a list of online resources that provide a basic foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (and they're linked again here). Once you have completed reading/watching/coding those, we have an assignment for you! The assignment should be completed and submitted to us for review before your first day of attending class.

We will be using a website called Codewars to test your knowledge of basic JavaScript. Personally, I like solving their exercises for fun, and I’ve identified 12 problems that I particularly enjoyed and that cover topics we will be using daily in class: Arrays, Objects, and String manipulation.

Now, you’re probably wondering _what the heck is a kyu?_ On Codewars, exercises are ranked in difficulty from 8 kyu (really easy) to 1 kyu (really, really hard).  So, the above problems aren't too difficult---just challenging enough to make sure that you’ll be able to do what we need to do.

So, that’s basically it. Sign up, do the problems, and send us an email when you’re done. **Please be sure to include your username in the email so that we can be sure we're looking at the right solutions.**

Below, I’ve included some screenshots and instructions for how to get started.
