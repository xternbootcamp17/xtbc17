We will be using Git for source code management--and hosting our repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com)--throughout the bootcamp. It will help if you're not seeing it for the first time.

Once again, one of these courses or the other should be plenty of preparation.

### Learn Git from Codecademy

[Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) is a free interactive course from Codecademy covering the fundamentals of version control with Git. As with the previous lessons, this can be completed entirely within the browser. This is the best browser-based introduction to Git that I've seen.

### Try Git from Code School

[Try Git](https://try.github.io/), created by Code School in partnership with GitHub, is another good intro to Git. It doesn't have you do quite as much yourself as the Codecademy course, so I don't like it quite as well. It does not, however, require you to sign up for anything---not even a free account.
